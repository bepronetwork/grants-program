### Overview

A DAO tooling platform to manage talent in a decentralized manner

GetBoarded aims to reimagine work, careers, and financial transactions in a decentralized community-led people ecosystems.
Let's imagine a better world and build the tools to enable that vision where people have a possibility to work for multiple Organizations.
Anyone can join the DAOs and have multiple income streams based on value that they add.
This differs from the gig economy in the way that no one corporation is managing these jobs, people work towards a value instead of selling
their time in the traditional work model.
Here people can join multiple organizations and communities to get a collective feed from all of them.
This way they can prioritize their commitments to skill & interest-based workstream.
The GetBoarded DAO will tackle all this.

BePro is itself a community of developers and web3 evangelists working together to provide frameworks to scale development and
initiatives in blockchain. We aim to develop web3 components for DAO tooling.
The components could be treasury, voting (judiciary), open projects, governance, communication and other productivity tools.

The future workplaces will be community-driven, people-focused, and technologically assisted.

### Project Details

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
https://www.figma.com/file/TLSEoR9lcEL4vDUmmHV9bx/gtbrdd?node-id=0%3A1

* An overview of the technology stack to be used
Web project in VUE stack with Node.js backend.
Web3 libraries being used: WalletConnect for User Login and NFT profile pic, Explore use of Superfluid for payments,
Uniswap for LP creation, and pricing, BadgerDAO for Yield Farming Strategy, Gnosis Safe for multisig approvals,
Covalent for DAO Transparency Dashboards with One Unified API,  Use of Org setup and Login with Unstoppable Domains

* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
https://github.com/getboarded-technology/banked

* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
Banked.getboarded.com
This simple POC provides a framework to extend the types of assignments: like project work, learning and development,
or simple rewards like follow of twitter and get XPs,
It can also be extended by types of validations, like through community voting, or by uploading a proof to be verified by admins, etc.
The tool can be multi network and multi-currency and with BANKED you can manage all your funds and currencies easily
while tracing all the movement of funds on-chain.

We have developed stand-alone POCs to test and validate the logical user flows. Banked.getboarded.com is once such POC
that was developed to create a treasury to add a Web3 flow to GetBoarded. Objective is to create an innovative multi network treasury
that can have micro credit distribution to its community members with a multi-sig approval mechanism.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
We are building tools for the next generation of DAOs for skill visibility, talent development and ecosystem management.
BePro network and its community would benefit from our solutions by forking or integrating our open tooling platform.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our own user base, other project developers.

* What need(s) does your project meet?
DAOs in the current form are exciting new concepts that need to gather adoption outside of crypto communities.
For this, general user experience and participations needs to improve.
Organizations of today's world are operating more like people driven online ecosystems more so because of the shift
to digital-first work scenarios. A need of tools that can help manage and operate these ecosystems has emerged.
We are building modular apps market where you can combine apps to custom build an Organizational system to operate a community.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem?
We have not encountered a tooling platform as we are envisioning in the ecosystem.
However, other projects may have an integration possibility with the tools we are developing.

* If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
Yes, many projects are coming up to provide tools specifically catering to the digital and web3 operating communities.
There have been hackathons conducted by ETH.DAOHack and Encode club DAO to encourage development in this space.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* academic publications relevant to the problem,
* links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
* references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the bepro network core team,
* previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to BEPRO Network. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding _needs to be below $30k for initial grants. This and the costs for each milestone need to be in USD; if the grant is paid out in BEPRO,the amount will be sent in BEPRO directly.
