# Bepro Network Grant Proposal

### Overview

Please provide the following:

* If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
One of a kind digital objects. 
* A brief description of your project.

Un1ke starts with a simple idea, help Artists and Local businesses onboarding the new Web 3.0 and embrace blockchain technology.
Most of the team comes from a traditional B2B business, working with some of the biggest brands in Portugal and some global brands.
This gives us a solid understanding of the market moves and what will be the next big opportunity and early this year we had the idea to set up a company that will not aim to be a Tech company for itself, but a transitional company that will help Artists and businesses, taking the leap to a blockchain environment. 

how do we believe we can do it?
since Kevin McCoy minted the first Nft, the proof of concept for Digital ownership was established, and on the 2017 NFT rise the realization of Digital intellectual property like Criptopunks and other brands made it clear that the future for IP and Creative rights will pass by blockchain technology.
From art to industrial design, passing by movies and 3d printing assets, in the near future everything will be own in an NFT or some variation of it.
So we hope to bring artists and companies closer to this "world" creating a clear and Legal way to ensure ownership and commercial rights to all the NFT created, this way we will bring the "real world" parametric to our NFTs.
To do this we developed several types of processes adapted to the needs of our 3 main areas, this processes will ensure the authenticity of our NFT and deliver a real value for the money product. 

* An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Bepro Network / Bepro-js
We believe that the key to success in WEB3.0 will a combination of strong technology and a great UX. We believe that Bepro tools can deliver both and integrated with a functional UI we are sure to deliver a great product to market.

* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We believe that people should be the owner of their creations, with the project we hope to deliver a tool that will create an easy and simpler way to protect your ideas to your art.
Of course on the business side, we see also a big opportunity in the industrial and copyright area. Most NFT platforms use art, music as main items, in Un1ke we will focus more on the business side and develop tools to serve that specific audience.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
see file upload on githuhb sitemap_interface

* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
We will offer a product suitable to private and corporate users, enabling easier proof of ownership.
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our audience goes from personal users to big industrial companies, we will offer simple pictures not mint to Concept project registration.
* What need(s) does your project meet?
We think that we can offer a better and simpler service for IP and copyright registration.

  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
 At the moment we think, that there´s no business with the goals we have.
