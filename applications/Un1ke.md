### Overview

Please provide the following:

* If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
One of a kind digital objects. 
* A brief description of your project.

Un1ke starts with a simple idea, help Artists and Local businesses onboarding the new Web 3.0 and embrace blockchain technology.
Most of the team comes from a traditional B2B business, working with some of the biggest brands in Portugal and some global brands.
This gives us a solid understanding of the market moves and what will be the next big opportunity and early this year we had the idea to set up a company that will not aim to be a Tech company for itself, but a transitional company that will help Artists and businesses, taking the leap to a blockchain environment. 

how do we believe we can do it?
since Kevin McCoy minted the first Nft, the proof of concept for Digital ownership was established, and on the 2017 NFT rise the realization of Digital intellectual property like Criptopunks and other brands made it clear that the future for IP and Creative rights will pass by blockchain technology.
From art to industrial design, passing by movies and 3d printing assets, in the near future everything will be own in an NFT or some variation of it.
So we hope to bring artists and companies closer to this "world" creating a clear and Legal way to ensure ownership and commercial rights to all the NFT created, this way we will bring the "real world" parametric to our NFTs.
To do this we developed several types of processes adapted to the needs of our 3 main areas, this processes will ensure the authenticity of our NFT and deliver a real value for the money product. 

* An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Bepro Network / Bepro-js
We believe that the key to success in WEB3.0 will a combination of strong technology and a great UX. We believe that Bepro tools can deliver both and integrated with a functional UI we are sure to deliver a great product to market.

* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
We believe that people should be the owner of their creations, with the project we hope to deliver a tool that will create an easy and simpler way to protect your ideas to your art.
Of course on the business side, we see also a big opportunity in the industrial and copyright area. Most NFT platforms use art, music as main items, in Un1ke we will focus more on the business side and develop tools to serve that specific audience.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
see file upload on githuhb sitemap_interface
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
We will offer a product suitable to private and corporate users, enabling easier proof of ownership.
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our audience goes from personal users to big industrial companies, we will offer simple pictures not mint to Concept project registration.
* What need(s) does your project meet?
We think that we can offer a better and simpler service for IP and copyright registration.
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem?
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
 At the moment we think, that there´s no business with the goals we have.

## Team :busts_in_silhouette:

### Team members

We don´t have a team leader, we work as a close group with an equal voice.

Nelson - Crypto user from 2018, he started in the crypto-verse on trading but pretty soon realized that trading was a waste of time and started developing skills on mining and rigging assembly, this was the starting point for him to embrace blockchain culture and go deeper into the rabbit hole.

Daniel - He comes from the money side of the business, with a master's degree in finances, Daniel brings us the financial side and how we can turn the idea into a business. Also is kind of a nerd and curious about software programming, and is always creating some kind of new thing and looking in ways that we can do it by ourselves making us more autonomous and innovative. 

José - José is a 20´s Master Brand, Graphic & Web Designer, that stumbles into crypto in 2018 when is invited to be part of two crypto projects, the early start of an investment fund and one for a retail company. From then to now, José is a crypto enthusiast, NFT collector, and Art lover.

André - He also comes from the creative side, with a focus on 3D and multimedia. Soon in his career, he discovers a taste for industrial design and later for Experience design, since then he has worked on projects around the world namely on festive lighting. Always on the innovation side of the business, he managed product development pipelines from communication protocols on electric grids to SAS and promotional app.

### Team's experience

Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful.

Please list the name of the project and legal entity here.

Like we discussed with Filipe, the team is quite inexperienced in blockchain projects. We have a really strong corporate background from project managing to design and finances.
We are in the process of onboarding a web developer and a blockchain developer so we can start developing the functional part of our business.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to BEPRO Network. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 9 months 
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  6 employes working 35hours per week a total of 1400hours per person until full project.
* **Total Costs:** For the initial goals on the platform, we believe that around 34K €ur will be enough to have the first version for the platform running.
