# Bepro Network Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Alphaday
* **Team Name:** Alphabox Solutions Pte. Ltd.
* **Payment Address:** 0x48e239Fa0B364Cd92Fc750A50045c9f9E04DD781 

### Overview

Please provide the following:

* If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary). \
Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.

* A brief description of your project. \
Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 

* An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Bepro Network / Bepro-js: \
As a data aggregator community dashboard, Alphaday is blockchain-agnostic.
That being said, Alphaday is built to be implemented as an auxiliary role. Having all this information in one place allows Bepro Network stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily stay up to date on Bepro Network ecosystem updates, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general, users who can track their favourite projects more easily stay more engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention.

* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project. \
Bepro Network’s decentralized infrastructure resonates with us since we’ve been trying to build and deploy web3 products for the last 5 years.
Our app is designed to generate interest, increase user engagement & retention, and educate new users with regard to cryptocurrency projects and the industry in general. 

### Project Details

Our product was launched in August 2022 and is live in Beta version at: https://app.alphaday.com

Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

Project fit: Social - A data aggregator as a Community dashboard.

Target audience: We aim to create a dashboard that serves any Bepro Network user, holders, developers, VCs, and pretty much any stakeholder whether they are completely new to the Bepro Network ecosystem or an expert.

Our dashboard aims to provide a single end-point from which users can consume all the information on a project they could possibly want. In this case, we would like to build a Bepro Network Community Dashboard that aggregates all the discussions, talking points, narratives, events, metrics, official announcements and much much more into one single dashboard. With one glance at this dashboard Bepro Network community members would have a top-down view of what is happening across the entire Bepro Network ecosystem. From this view they could then jump deeper into their areas of interest (i.e. devs to dev documentation, BEPRO holders to twitter and reddit discussions, investors to on-chain metrics across both Bepro Network’s own pages and to third-party data providers)

Alphaday has no direct competitors as it aims to recreate a crypto user’s daily workflow (i.e. their general experience) inside a single dashboard. i.e. if a Bepro Network ecosystem participant wakes up, checks their portfolio, reads twitter, browses the Bepro Network governance forum, listens to the latest podcast featuring Bepro Network team members,  does a bit of on-chain research, instead of having this workflow spread across a dozen tabs, it’s all available within a single screen on Alphaday.

## Development Status :open_book:

Our app is already live at: https://app.alphaday.com/

We have already signed several agreements with other projects and are currently working on releasing their dashboards. You can already see a few of these dashboards live in the web-app (e.g. Verasity, Impossible Finance, Arbitrum) and several more are on their way within the next month.

Besides building dashboards for specific projects, we are simultaneously working on developing and improving our app’s features, widgets, content, and performance.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Milestone 1 — Development and Deployment of Initial Dashboard

**Estimated Duration:** 2 months \
**FTE:**  0.5 \
**Costs:** 1,300 USD

We would like to create a Bepro Network ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Blog | The latest Bepro Network official announcements and blog post content. |
| 2. | News | A feed of all news mentions of Bepro Network from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet. |
| 3. | Calendar | A calendar containing all Bepro Network events including Bepro Network Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with Bepro Network bounties, AMAs. | 
| 4. | Podcasts | Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Bepro Network team members. |  
| 5. | Videos | Youtube stream containing educational Bepro Network content. |  
| 6. | Documentation | BEPRO docs directory. |  
| 7. | Social Media | Twitter & Discord Integration to show a feed of latest discussions. |  
| 8. | Other Info | FAQs & BEPRO tokenomics information. |  
| 9. | Devs & Builders | Grants & Bounties links with descriptions and other resources to guide devs and builders. |  
| 10. | Careers | Bepro Network Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed. | 
| 11. | Ecosystem & App | Links and descriptions of Dapps and other platforms within the BEPRO ecosystem. |  
| 12. | Roadmap | A widget featuring the Bepro Network roadmap with all the descriptions and links included. | 
| 13. | Data Analytics | Bepro Network metrics including DEX volume, transaction volumes and other metrics pulled in from Dune Analytics. | 

We should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Bepro Network dashboard by May 2023.

Thereafter, we will maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.

Please note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as required by your team. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/  

### Milestone 2 — Maintenance

**Estimated Duration:** 12 months continuous \
**FTE:**  0.5 \
**Costs:** 1,200 USD

| 1. | Maintenance & Curation | Continuous daily maintenance and curation of content of the dashboard by a specialist over a year. |  

### Milestone Summary

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months for deployment, 12 months of maintenance.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 1 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 2,500 USD


## Future Plans

In addition to building the Bepro Network dashboard, we will be constantly monitoring and improving existing features on Alphaday and adding new widgets and features as we go along. These enhancements will automatically apply to the Bepro Dashboard.

In terms of numbers:
We’ve been growing MAU 40% month-on-month with minimal marketing as we wanted to build a solid and stable product before scaling up our marketing but we expect to reach 10k MAU by March and overall our goal is to 10x our MAU every year.

Considering Bepro Network has 35K twitter followers and using this as a very crude proxy for community size, we would consider it a success if we could serve at least 3% of them on a monthly basis (1.05K MAU).

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**  Website

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

If we get this grant, we will start working on the board immediately and we should have it ready within 2 months. Once we’ve launched the board, we will do user interviews and feedback sessions to tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that Bepro stakeholders truly love to use.

We are in the process of applying for grants to further develop our app and dashboard. More than a dozen projects have already approved to fund us and we are currently in the process of building or have already released their dashboards. You can see the ones already released at https://app.alphaday.com/ to get a brief idea of how “https://app.alphaday.com/b/bepro” would look like.
