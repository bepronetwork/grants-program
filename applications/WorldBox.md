### Overview

Please provide the following:

* Audience Driven, Interactive TV.
* Broadcast entertainment which uses viewer input to shape the way a show evolves in realtime. Long term goal of using user interaction to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to create it's own unique narratives, thus creating unique experiences, on demand, on a per viewer basis.
* WorldBox will use the Bepro base code to build the projects token, dex, market and associated NFTs which will drive and reward viewer interaction.
* The WorldBox team is interested in this project as it would be the first to create truly interactive media - the inevitable blurring of the line between gaming and movies where a viewer can go anywhere and do anything, within a basic narrative framework.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* While the WorldBox App will have a traditional UI for menus etc. the interactive aspects will be created on a per production basis i.e. each interactive scene will have a custom built responsive overlay through which viewers will be able to provide input. The first WorldBox production 'Loop' will be live footage, but future production may be built from pre-rendered animation, with the final goal being to use a game game engine to render scenes in real time. 
* Due to the highly complex nature of our final goal of creating 'completely interactive' media we have purposely simplified the interactive elements of the project for the first production so we can focus on perfecting the base mechanics i.e. gathering a massive amount of user input and executing it within a live broadcast. In essense the API in initial productions can be defined as a 'crowd funded narrative'.
* An overview of the technology stack to be used - to be determind.
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed - in progress.
* The WorldBox system was initially developed as a completely analog system of physical sets (as in film sets) and a pen and paper D&D style show, with live actors playing multiple roles and having several costume changes. While Jono Heaney (the projects creator) still hopes to put on a performance like this, he admits it would be a vanity project with a unfeasible budget. The well developed documentation for this flavour of the WorldBox project is available on request.
* Listing the limitations of the project is an interesting subject as when you fully understand what the end goal of WorldBox is, there is very little the system could not be retasked to do. Leading with this has proven to be a sure way of seeding doubt due to the sheer magnitude of the projects scope, as such, we have started to excluded it almost completely from the marketing and investment material. In short: Once we have developed a system that can accurately replicate the nuances of humour, love, hate, satire etc. within the human frame of reference, it could be set to simulate any manner of tasks in a billion differnt ways, thus finding the most efficient way of completing them, and given the correct interface, perform them better than a human ever could.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* In it's initial stages WorldBox will form a bridge between Interactive Games, Passive Broadcast Media, NFT collectibles and Personal wealth.
* We are looking to bring the massive global audience typically associated with Passive Media into the realm of Interacive Games.
* WorldBox will provide entertainment for the masses, who will in term provide backpropogation for train the WorldBox ANN.
* As yet there are no similar projects within the Bepro or other networks that we are aware of.

## Development Status :open_book:
Not Applicable

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* academic publications relevant to the problem,
* links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
* references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the bepro network core team,
* previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to BEPRO Network. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding _needs to be below $30k for initial grants. This and the costs for each milestone need to be in USD; if the grant is paid out in BEPRO,the amount will be sent in BEPRO directly.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement First Modules

* **Estimated duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 8,000 USDC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |

* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 4,000 USDC

## Future Plans

WorldBox has been carefully segmented so as each portion of the project can stand alone as an appealing (in terms entertainment) and profitable business venture. Each subsequent stage is designed to fund the next, adding more interaction and collecting more user data (in terms of how humans like to experience a narrative.)


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**  I initially left a message via the Bepro webform enquiring what the process would be to setup my own NFT gallery (due to being lost in the deluge of Open Sea - you can find my work here https://opensea.io/theMilitantBitCollective ) Filipe contacted me and through this interaction I learnt about the BUIDL initiative. 

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

Not Applicable at this point in time.
