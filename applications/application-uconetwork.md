### Overview

Please provide the following:

* UCO Network (Used Cooking Oil Network).
* A Blockchain Solution that contributes for an efficient waste traceability and mitigates the risk of fraud in Advanced BioFuels Production.
* An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Bepro Network / Bepro-js
* We are creating an ecosystem that promotes environmental sustainable behaviors and rewards its participants.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? A high demand of UCO (used cooking oil) combined with limited supply requires strong rules and regulations. Current rules and regulations lead to a non-transparent certification process of the sustainability of UCO – that is a opportunity for bad actors.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)? Our user base. UCO Producers (i.e. Restaurants, Families), Waste Collection Companies and Transport Companies, BioFuel Producers (Plants), UCO Trading Companies, Audit Companies.

* What need(s) does your project meet? UCO Network addresses the needs originating from the below market problems:
High UCO demand for Biofuel production - Needs transparency, verification and traceability solutions
Fraud Opportunity - current certification, audit and sustainability systems are insufficient to prevent fraud
UCO Supply chain monitoring and control systems are not secure or streamlined
Auditors cannot look into each other’s information systems – No harmonized tools
Difficult to prove or rely on provenance data
No single source of truth for sustainable UCO production, such as a blockchain
Biofuel Producers struggle to find verified/certified UCO when they need it
Compliance with EU RED II is needed

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem? No
  * If so, how is your project different? Our project addresses the specific problems of the UCO market.
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? No

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* academic publications relevant to the problem, https://cedelft.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/CE_Delft__200247_UCO_as_biofuel_feedstock_in_EU_FINAL-v5.pdf
* links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
* references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the bepro network core team,
* previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to BEPRO Network. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
