# Bepro Network Grant Proposal
* **Project Name:** Interface bepro.js <> Crypto.com Pay
* **Team Name:** Crypto.com Pay


### Overview
The goal of this project is to create an interface and implementation of Crypto.com on BEPRO Network. 

In practical terms, it consists of creating a bepro.js method and class to allow anyone using BEPRO’s framework to easily add payment solutions to their applications, using Crypto.com Pay.

The grant will fund a public bounty for developers who wish to take the challenge and build the integration and merge it with our codebase. The final solution and code, that will be accepted to be included in the official bepro.js framework, will receive the bounty.

The integration will make it super easy and accessible to add payments support in more than 30 different coins to anyone who’s developing a dApp with bepro-js, and will allow them to start accepting payments from 30M+ cryptocurrency users globally.

Adding the possibility to easily support payments will considerably increase the overall value of the framework for all the developers that use it. A feature like the payment gateway will also certainly bring many more developers to the community.


### Ecosystem Fit
There is an immense fit for this project to bring a lot of value to the ecosystem and community.

BEPRO Network already allows many applications to be built with the existing codebase. Adding the possibility to easily support payments will considerably increase the overall value of the framework for all the developers that use it.
A feature like the payment gateway will also certainly bring many more developers to the community.

We believe there are many use cases of applications built with bepro.js, that could benefit from this gateway. Some examples can be found below:

* NFTs & Digital Art
  * Art galleries, with their own brand and identity, can use the gateway to sell art directly using crypto payments, avoiding using other marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible;
  * Bidding mechanisms for Art Galleries, where they place specific pieces on sale using NFTs, can be made if you allow payments to be done directly from the bidders;
  * NFT projects in the digital collectibles or music world can also take advantage of payment gateways. This allows the artists to directly receive the payments for their audiences, removing the middleman from the equation

* Gaming - Games are also a great way to apply payment mechanisms and use the Crypto.com Pay gateway.
  * A trading-card game where each card is minted and generated in the blockchain, can allow the users to buy and sell directly the cards with fiat money;
  * Allow game developers to allow players to buy and sell directly in-game tokens, which are then issued on the blockchain;

* Digital Money & DeFi
  * Bepro is also used for several projects in the DeFi space that could benefit from a direct payment mechanism, including automated market makers, or projects that have staking mechanisms for their tokens.
