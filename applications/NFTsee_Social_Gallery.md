* The platoform will leverage bepro.js NFTfactory smart contract functions that will alow the platform to work as follows:

  * "News feed" page where users are able to search for other platyform users @username to add as a freind where both parties will sign with wallet to agree to share eachothers NFTs with one another.
  * We are currently in the process of finding a suitable front end to build the UI on. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Our project fits into the ecosystem due to being in the NFT sector leverageing existing bepro codbase (customization needed)
* Our target audience is everyone and anyone that currently holds or will hold NFT artwork. Designers, creators and maybe some of raible/openseas user base.
* The need for a universal NFT viewing/interaction platform that does not currently exist.
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem? N/A
  * If so, how is your project different? N/A
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? Yes Rarible/opensea allthough they mainly act as a marketplace but have some of our platforms functions
