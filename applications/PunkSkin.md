### Project Details (in development) 

w.i.p

### Ecosystem Fit

PunkSkin is a unique digital art collectibles a.k.a non-fungible tokens (NFT) that are programmatic generated. 
There will only be 10,000 unique generated PunkSkin to be release into the Ethereum BlockChain.
Due to the limited supply, PunkSkin are made digitally scarce in the NFTs' blockchain ecosystem.


* PunkSkin can be trade and collect in the NFTs ecosyctem.
* PunkSkin is made for passionate digital art collectors and traders. 
* There are plenty of new generative art lunched every months as we speak and the most reconiged ones are the O.G CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Top Dog Beach Club, etc.
  * As a 3D/2D artist working in the creative industrail for more than 10 years, quality/style and passion are the ingredient to create an impeccable masterpiece.
  * Jamie Hewlett's art really resonates with me, he is best known as the co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl and co-creator of the virtual band Gorillaz. PunkSkin's art direction will definitely be inspired by Jamie Hewlett's art style.
