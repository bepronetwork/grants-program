# Bepro Network Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** WorldBox.tv
* **Team Name:** WorldBox.tv
* **Payment Address:** 0x98ff0CD86B39Cf1f505372DBa30292e7E8024511 (MetaMask ETH Mainnet)


### Overview

* Audience Driven, Interactive TV.
* Broadcast entertainment which uses viewer input to shape the way a show evolves in realtime. Long term goal of using user interaction to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to create it's own unique narratives, thus creating unique experiences, on demand, on a per viewer basis.
* WorldBox will use the Bepro base code to build the projects token, dex, market and associated NFTs which will drive and reward viewer interaction.
* The WorldBox team is interested in this project as it would be the first to create truly interactive media - the inevitable blurring of the line between gaming and movies where a viewer can go anywhere and do anything, within a basic narrative framework.

### Project Details

* WorldBox has been split into multiple, stand alone stages. This first stage will culminate in the broadcast of the first WorldBox Production, an interactive show streamed on the WorldBox App through which viewers will be able interact and earn production specific NFTs and WOX, the WorldBox token. All the blockchain aspects of this foundation stage (token, market, NFT factory etc.) will be built on the Bepro base code.
* While the WorldBox App will have a traditional UI for menus etc. the interactive aspects will be created on a per production basis i.e. each interactive scene will have a custom built responsive overlay through which viewers will be able to provide input. The first WorldBox production 'Loop' will be live footage, but future production may be built from pre-rendered animation, with the final goal being to use a game engine to render scenes in real time. 
* Due to the highly complex nature of our final goal of creating 'completely interactive' media we have purposely simplified the interactive elements of the project for the first production so we can focus on perfecting the base mechanics i.e. gathering a massive amount of user input and executing it within a live broadcast. In essence, the API in initial productions can be defined as a 'crowd funded narrative'.
* Our technology stack for this initial stage will consist of an App based front end. All calculations of viewer score, allocation of crypto rewards, NFTs etc. as well as the hosting and streaming of content will obviously be handled on the server side.
* Due to the large scope of the project, especially in terms of verticle and horizontal scalability, we are running an ongoing scoping exercise which will determine exactly which core components, protocols, architecture, etc. will be deployed. Since this will be a task paid for by WorldBox, some of these aspects (such as final hosting solutions) will only be determind once we start developing the primary elements of the app, which will come after we have completed the block chian aspects of the project.
* The WorldBox system was initially developed as a completely analog system of physical sets (as in film sets) and a pen and paper D&D style show, with live actors playing multiple roles and having several costume changes. While Jono Heaney (the projects creator) still hopes to put on a performance like this, he admits it would be a vanity project with a unfeasible budget. The well developed documentation for this flavour of the WorldBox project is available on request.
* Listing the limitations of the project is an interesting subject as when you fully understand what the end goal of WorldBox is, there is very little the system could not be retasked to do. Leading with this has proven to be a sure way of seeding doubt due to the sheer magnitude of the projects scope, as such, we have started to excluded it almost completely from the marketing and investment material. In short: Once we have developed a system that can accurately replicate the nuances of humour, love, hate, satire etc. within the human frame of reference, it could be set to simulate any manner of tasks in a billion different ways, thus finding the most efficient way of completing them, and given the correct interface, perform them better than a human ever could.

### Ecosystem Fit

* In it's initial stages WorldBox will form a bridge between Interactive Games, Passive Broadcast Media, NFT collectibles and Personal wealth.
* We will be using NFTs with built in atributes as a way to personalise and manage individual viewer experiences.
* We are looking to bring the massive global audience typically associated with Passive Media into the realm of Interactive Games.
* WorldBox will provide entertainment for the masses, who will in turn provide the backpropagation needed to train the WorldBox ANN.
* As yet there are no similar projects within the Bepro or other networks that we are aware of.

### Milestone 3 — App design and Pre-Production process

* **Estimated Duration:** 90 Days
* **FTE:**  17
* **Costs:** $38 000

* Create WorldBox DEX - This will contain a single liquidity pool of USDC which can only be swapped for WOX tokens, which are held in various Prize Pool wallets (established for each production built on the system), as well as in user wallets. WOX tokens of a value equivalent to each USDC input are auto-minted and sent to the relevant wallet(s), with said USDC being inserted into the liquidity pool. The DEX needs to keep track of the total circulating supply of WOX tokens and calculate their value according to Total USDC in the liquidity pool. WOX tokens are burnt when swapped for USDC. Incoming transactions (i.e USDC into the pool) are charged a 3% fee, outgoing transactions (i.e. USDC out of pool) are charged 10%. Half of these fees are sent to the WorldBox Dev wallet, the other half are returned to the liquidity pool.
* Hold Stage 1 ICO - Backers pre-purchase a limited quantity of WOX tokens which will only be minted and airdropped just before the 1st production goes live. Backers will also be airdropped rare Earning Multiplier NFTs according to their invested amount.

## Future Plans

* WorldBox has been carefully segmented so as each portion of the project can stand alone as an appealing (in terms entertainment) and profitable business venture. Each subsequent stage is designed to fund the next, adding more interaction and collecting more user data (in terms of how humans like to experience a narrative.)
* From this point forward, with well established systems and templates in place, WorldBox will:
* - Develop and broadcast new shows on the system.
* - Develop new mini games and increasingly complex interactive elements.
* - Begin developing the data miner which collects audience input in such a way as to map out narrative patterns. With a working, profitable system in place we will be looking to partner up with companies who are working on Artificial Neural Networks, such as OpenAI.
* - Look to license the broadcast system to established shows (such as Survivor and The Bachelorette) which can be rejuvenated through the incorporation of audience input.
* - Look to license the content and app to major streaming platforms (such as Netflix) - Although we will be looking to make these agreements from a much earlier stage as part of our film production phase.
* - WorldBox Film Factory -  In later stages we will be opening up the platform to independant film makers who, with the support of the WorldBox team, will be able to pitch new interactive projects to token holders. This will allow viewers to directly fund the productions they want to see using WorldBox tokens, and recieve a portion of revenue generated by that production in return. Decentralised film making! Content by the people, for the people.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**  
* I initially left a message via the Bepro webform enquiring what the process would be to setup my own NFT gallery (due to being lost in the deluge of Open Sea - you can find my work here https://opensea.io/theMilitantBitCollective ) Filipe contacted me and through this interaction I learnt about the BUIDL initiative which I realised would be perfect to develop the blockchain aspect of my Interactive TV concept I had been working on for several years.
